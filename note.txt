Mesh processing and mesh deformation is an important research topic in the geometric modeling community,with important practical applications. 

It allows users with relatively little technical knowledge to model complex freeform shapes through simple and intuitive interfaces. 

In a recent research, used a mesh-based deformation.

One of the problems with the typical mesh-based deformation approaches.

It may lead to defects in the input triangle mesh, such as self-intersection.

In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose an algorithm where a sampling of the triangle mesh is deformed and the deformed surface is obtained from applying a surface reconstruction algorithm to the de- formed point cloud.
